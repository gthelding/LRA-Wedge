## Overview

**Flex Broadcast Wedge** (`flex-wedge.py`) is a Python script that allows SmartSDR clients to discover and connect to a FlexRadio transceiver on a remote network via the LRA Wireguard VPN, bypassing the need for a SmartLink account. *Note: MacOS users do not need to use this script.*

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- LRA Wireguard VPN connection to the remote FlexRadio network
- FlexRadio SmartSDR Software

---

## Installation

### Installing Python on Windows

If you do not already have Python installed, download the latest version for Windows from the official Python website:

- [Download Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)[^1]

After downloading, run the installer and **ensure you check the box to "Add Python to PATH"** during installation for easier command-line use.

To verify your installation, open `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell` and run:

```powershell
python --version
```

or

```powershell
py --version
```

You should see output such as `Python 3.x.x` indicating Python is installed.

### Install Dependencies

From your terminal or command prompt, run:

```powershell
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### 1) Connect to LRA Wireguard VPN
### 2) Connect to DLI to Power ON FlexRadio
### 3) Open up SmartSDR
### 4) Run the Script

a. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**
    - Press the `Win` key, type `cmd` or `PowerShell`, and press `Enter`.
